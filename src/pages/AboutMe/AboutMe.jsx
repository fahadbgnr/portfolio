            I'm <span className="font-semibold text-green-600">Sheikh Fahad</span>, a passionate frontend developer from Bangladesh with a strong interest in crafting clean, responsive, and engaging user interfaces using modern web technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            My programming journey began during university, where I quickly developed a deep enthusiasm for building interactive apps and solving real-world problems with code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy playing cricket üèè, staying updated with the latest tech trends, and learning about entrepreneurship and innovation through books and videos.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-600 font-medium">
            I'm a fast learner and always open to exploring new tools, frameworks, and opportunities to grow as a developer.
